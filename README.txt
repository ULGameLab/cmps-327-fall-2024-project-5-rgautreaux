README File for Project 5


Using the class slides, I did my best to follow the given instructions but I am still experiencing some bugs and issues.  Despite my efforts, the player and enemy objects don't move and stay stagnant in the maze.

First, I applied the knowledge I gained from the class lecture and slides to the Pathfinding Task in the instructions. However, a couple of issues stemming from functions not recognizing each other resulted in errors.  After the standard A* Algorithm, I did the segment that correlated with my Honors Contract, and wrote the A* Enemy Path Finding Code, facing similar issues along the way.  Once all Pathfinding Code was written, I scripted out the required enemy behaviors to the best of my ability.

I ended up meeting with the TA, who helped me with my syntax errors and assisted in correcting the target goal for the enemies to follow, as the code I had originally resulted in them chasing themselves.  However, despite my code now being able to run, I then ran into the issue of neither the player nor the enemies following their scripted directions.  This is the issue I am still dealing with currently and have not yet found a solution for. At first, it seemed to be a matter regarding queues, but now it is unclear as to what the root cause could be.  I have struggled in trying to get to the bottom of it alone.
